# Python Frameworks
Simple applications built in various Python frameworks.


## Frameworks

##### Bottle
Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library

http://bottlepy.org/

##### CherryPy
CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web framework.

http://www.cherrypy.org/

##### Cyclone
Cyclone is a web server framework for Python, that implements the Tornado API as a Twisted protocol.

##### Django
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

##### Falcon
Falcon is a ridiculously fast, minimalist Python web framework for building cloud APIs and app backends.

##### Flask
Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.

http://flask.pocoo.org/

##### Klein
Klein is a micro-framework for developing production-ready web services with
Python. It is 'micro' in that it has an incredibly small API similar to Bottle
and Flask. It is not 'micro' in that it depends on things outside the standard
library. This is primarily because it is built on widely used and well tested
components like Werkzeug and Twisted.

##### Muffin
Muffin is a fast, simple and asyncronous web-framework for Python 3.

##### Pyramid
Pyramid is a small, fast, down-to-earth Python web framework. It is developed as part of the Pylons Project. It is licensed under a BSD-like license.

##### Tornado
Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed. By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.

##### TurboGears2
TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take advantage of
new components, and to provide a fully customizable WSGI (Web Server Gateway
Interface) stack. From the beginning TurboGears was designed to be a Full Stack
framework built from best-of-breed components. New components have been
released which improved on the ones in the original TGstack, and the Python web
world has been increasingly designed around WSGI.

##### Twisted
Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python and licensed under the open source MIT license. Twisted runs on Python 2 and an ever growing subset also works with Python 3.
