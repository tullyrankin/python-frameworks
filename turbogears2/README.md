# TurboGears Web Framework
TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take advantage of
new components, and to provide a fully customizable WSGI (Web Server Gateway
Interface) stack. From the beginning TurboGears was designed to be a Full Stack
framework built from best-of-breed components. New components have been
released which improved on the ones in the original TGstack, and the Python web
world has been increasingly designed around WSGI.
