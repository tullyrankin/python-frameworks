# CherryPy Web Framework
CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web framework.

CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they
would build any other object-oriented Python program. This results in smaller
source code developed in less time.

CherryPy is now more than ten years old and it is has proven to be fast and
reliable. It is being used in production by many sites, from the simplest to
the most demanding.
